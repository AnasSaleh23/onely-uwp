# Onely UWP

A Universal Windows version of the Onely music player, written in C#. Like the original Onely, this is a bare-bones music / playlist player that's light on memory and CPU and that leaves your files and folders untouched. 

### Work in Progress

This project is currently still in progress. The View is completely provisional and needs attention. Save / Save As / Rename functionality needs to be added, as well as basic user settings. Testing for certain UWP-specific restrictions needs to be done (i.e, long-term permissions access to files in older playlists, regardless of where those files are stored).
