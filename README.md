# Onely UWP

A Universal Windows version of the [Onely](https://github.com/mphonic/onely) music player, written in C#. Like the original Onely, this is a light, fast, and friendly music and playlist player.

### Work in Progress

This project is currently still in progress. The View is completely provisional and needs attention. Save / Save As / Rename functionality needs to be added to the UX layer, as well as basic user settings. Testing for certain UWP-specific restrictions needs to be done (i.e, long-term permissions access to files in older playlists, regardless of where those files are stored). But, it currently does play, shuffle, repeat and allow editing on playlists.
