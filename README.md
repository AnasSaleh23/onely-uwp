# Onely UWP

A [Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) version of the [Onely](https://github.com/mphonic/onely) music player, written in C#. Like the original Onely, this is a light, fast, and friendly music playlist player.

### Work in Progress

This project is currently still in progress. It is currently highly useable under most scenarios, but the design needs adjustment for smaller views, and it could use some "flair". Testing for certain UWP-specific restrictions needs to be done (i.e, long-term permissions access to files in older playlists, regardless of where those files are stored).
